# LLBMOF 

## How to use it ?
If you only want to see the output of the code, open the Example.pynb file and run it, it contains information about each step (only GoDec works at the moment)

### Structure of the repo:
- goDec.py : contains the function that performs the Low Rank Representation of a video cube matrix X.
- flowAlgorithm.py : contains the function that performs the Latice Boltzman method
- Example.ipynb : notebook that executes the two algorithms 
- Resources : contains the images and the video of the demo
